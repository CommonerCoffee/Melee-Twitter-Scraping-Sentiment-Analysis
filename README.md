# Melee-Twitter-Scraping-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project I analyze 50,000 Tweets scraped from the Melee video game community using Sentiment Analysis with the Natural Language Progrmaming tool VADER. 

I create a Time Series plot to visualize the downward spiral the community experienced during 2020 and grouped players of each character to investigate which demographic tends to be the most positive and negative. 

Future plans for this may involve surveying across the greater Melee community for a more robust dataset.
